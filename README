Last tagged version, not used in debian, but used for minor doc modifications
to sourceforge.net: 2.01.02a (this line can be removed when upgrading beyond
2.01.02). 

To create a new debian package:

    0. Do
        setenv DEBEMAIL f.b.brokken@rug.nl

        Make sure that `cvsremove' has been called before running 
        `build clean'

    1. Keep the yodl/ name
    
    2. Define the next version in yodl/src/config.h

       THEN (upgrade the version for each new distribution):

            cd yodl/debian
            dch -v 2.01.02
            cd ../..


    (See also: file:///usr/share/doc/maint-guide/
                                maint-guide.en.html/ch-update.en.html):

    3. Build a new, complete, package:
        run on a clean checkout:
            (file:///usr/share/doc/maint-guide/
                maint-guide.en.html/ch-build.en.html#s-completebuild):

        From the directory where this file is located in, do:

        cvsremove
        cd yodl
        dpkg-buildpackage -mf.b.brokken@rug.nl -rfakeroot

        cd ..
        cvsrestore

    optionally:
        cvs commit 
        cvs tag v<version>-<revision>-<subrevision>
        
    4. Partial reruns (instead of full recompilation from scratch):
        run in yodl/

            fakeroot debian/rules binary

    or

        dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

See /usr/local/etc/sourceforce for info about upgrades to sourceforge.net.
