    This is the top-level directory of the Yodl program source tree.

    The directory `sourceforge' is probably not useful for anybody but me, but
    since it serves an important role for me in uploading the Yodl docs to
    sourceforge, they belong to this project. The same may hold true for the
    yodl/debian directory at some point in the future, e.g., when the debian
    configuration is moved to 

        https://svn.openfmi.net/debian-addons-bg/yodl

    When this happens, the debian directory might be removed from this archive.

    To create a source archive, run

        ./sourcetar

    This will create an archive named like yodl_2.04.tar.gz. 

    It will NOT contain the debian directory. If you need it, copy yodl/debian
    to where you want it, or remove the line `debian' from the file `excluded'
    before running ./sourcetar

    To create an `upstream debian archive' provide sourcetar with an (any)
    argument. E.g.,

        ./sourcetar upstream

    This will create an archive named like yodl_1.45.orig.tar.gz

    It will NOT contain the debian directory. If you need it, copy yodl/debian
    to where you want it, or remove the line `debian' from the file `excluded'
    before running ./sourcetar


    The version numbers will of course always reflect yodl's current version.

    The `distribution' script is also probably not useful to anybody but me,
    and it may be removed from new distributions at some future point in time.

    
    To create the program from its sources, either descend into the yodl
    directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
    and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.

    Yodl's version is defined in yodl/src/config.h
