In e.g., parserpushfun and at other situations where voids and function
pointers are mixed (e.g., yodl/gramchar.c, parser/parser.h)

    The weird casts are to get rid of the const to obtain a plain void *
    However, I think I'll change the type of the stack elements so that it 
    can store void *, void const *, and the parser's functions

None so far
