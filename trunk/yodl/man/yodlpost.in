manpagedescription()

    The bf(Yodl) post processor is used to solve references into the converted
    text, and to split (where appropriate) the converted bf(Yodl) text in
    parts. Some conversions do not require post-processing, such as LaTeX(),
    but most do. Therefore, in most cases a bf(Yodl) conversion consists of
    two phases:
    itemization(
    it() First, bf(yodl)(1) is called, producing a raw output file and an
        associated em(index) file;
    it() Then, bf(yodlpost)(1) is called, converting these two files into a
        final document.
    )
    Normally, bf(yodl2...)(1) scripts are used to perform complete bf(Yodl)
    conversions. 

manpageoptions()

    bf(-x ext): extension of the em(out)-file(s) if different from em(out)'s
    extension itself. If omitted, and em(out) has no extension, em(ypp) (Yodl
    Post Processor) is used.

    value is returned.
