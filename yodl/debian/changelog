yodl (2.00.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor repairs of txt-conversion em() and bf() macros

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Wed, 13 Oct 2004 16:35:16 +0200

yodl (2.00.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added .../macros/rawmacros/xxsetmandocumentheader.raw, provided by Karel
    Kubat allowing man-conversions for article, books, report, etc;
    Added new counter XXused to indicate that a list has been used in XML mode,
    adapted related macros accordingly;
    Repaired several inconsistencies in enumeration()/itemization(), following
    Karel's hints;
    Repaired references to xml-skeletons, which were consistently expected in
    /usr/share/yodl rather than in /usr/share/yodl/xml/

yodl (2.00.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * yodlpost/handleignorews.cc: called file_copy2offset(src, dest, offset)
    rather than file_copy2offset(dest, src, offset). Happened only here.
    Added some comment to file_copy2offset() itself, and repaired
    itemization() and enumeration() macros.  
    Added minor modifications to macros/build and manual/yo/manual.yo.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Mon, 27 Sep 2004 21:06:12 +0200

yodl (2.00.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * - Added the standard htmlstylesheet() and htmlheadopt() macros to be used
    in the html converter to add, respectively, a stylesheet or any option
    into the head of html files.
    - Modified yodl2whatever to deduct the default output filename from the
    last specified .yo file

yodl (2.00.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * eit() in the text-convertor did not properly handle the XXenumcounter

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Tue, 21 Sep 2004 15:09:58 +0200

yodl (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Complete rewrite. See the manual for the modifications. Old yodl-sources
    will usually require minor modifications

yodl (1.31.18-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the lexer, if we've stepped back over all pre-pushed input, ensure
    that future pushes reallocate the buffer rather than underrunning
    (closes: #203599).
  * Check policy up to 3.5.6: no changes required. Work is needed on
    compiler options for later versions.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Sep 2003 08:23:03 +0100

yodl (1.31.18-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simply remove root-owned out/dummy.dep files in the clean target rather
    than trying to chown them to $LOGNAME, which doesn't work under pbuilder
    (closes: #189620).
  * Use '%option noyywrap' rather than the messy local definition of
    yywrap(), which doesn't build properly with current flex.
  * Remove src/yodl2html-post/parser.c on clean to avoid bizarre build
    failures (thanks, Daniel Schepler).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  2 May 2003 09:21:08 +0100

yodl (1.31.18-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reinstate URL in control file, as it's useful for people browsing
    http://packages.debian.org/ (thanks, Oohara Yuuma).
  * Remove some cruft from debian/rules.
  * Use dh_installinfo rather than the incorrect code in debian/postinst and
    debian/prerm (which looked at /usr/info!).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Nov 2002 20:34:34 +0000

yodl (1.31.18-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove URL/authors from control file (should just be in copyright file).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Jul 2002 00:37:11 +0100

yodl (1.31.18-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make startit() and endit() correctly generate <ul></ul> rather than
    <dl></dl> (thanks, Frank B. Brokken).
  * Update Frank's e-mail address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Jan 2002 15:25:22 +0000

yodl (1.31.18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #111032).
  * Reintroducing package to unstable because five packages build-depend on
    it. When those packages migrate to a different documentation system,
    yodl may safely be removed.

  * Unexport NAME in debian/rules; the Hurd sets it, which confuses stepmake
    (closes: #111019, #111085).
  * ' generates \&' rather than \' for groff -man output, as \' is an acute
    accent, not an apostrophe (thanks, Matt Kraai; closes: #51258).
  * Recommend python rather than python1.5. yodl seems to work fine with
    newer versions of python, and python1.5 wouldn't have worked because it
    doesn't provide /usr/bin/python.
  * Add build-dependencies.
  * Policy version 3.2.1.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 20:09:33 +0000

yodl (1.31.18-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non Maintainer Upload.
  * Package is orphaned, setting Maintainer to Debian QA Group.
  * Apply patch from James Troup to fix build issues. (Closes: #119172)
  * Fix Python Recommends. (Closes: #119204)
  * Fix all lintian errors. (Fix changelog, strip binaries, remove
    INSTALL.txt)
  * Remove dh_suidregister from debian/rules.

 -- Steve Kowalik <stevenk@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Nov 2001 12:10:11 +1100

yodl (1.31.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
  * New upstream version

 -- Scott Hanson <shanson@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Dec 1999 10:56:51 +0100

yodl (1.31.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Partially upgraded to standards version 3.0.1:
     - Updated copyright to point to /usr/share/common-licenses
     - First step towards FHS-compliance: Man and info pages are now
       installed under /usr/share.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Aug 1999 02:41:38 -0600

yodl (1.31.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Re-added Yodl info page and added doc-base support.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Mar 1999 00:47:31 -0700

yodl (1.31.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [debian/control]: Updated to Standards-Version: 2.5.0.0
  * [debian/copyright]: Updated the address to the upstream FTP site.
  * Various minor clean-ups.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Feb 1999 14:09:47 -0700

yodl (1.31.7-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, mostly bugfixes.
  * Tweaked debian/rules aclocal.m4 (hence configure) to make sure that
    yodl is compiled with optimization "-O2" turned on.
  * s/-mgs/-ms/g in config.make.in and yodlconverters.yo.in because
    Debian's groff only has -ms, not -mgs.
  * [debian/control]: Recommends: groff.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Nov 1998 03:04:58 -0700

yodl (1.31.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Documentation/GNUmakefile]: Removed "texinfo" that was added to
      "default:" in Debian's yodl_1.31.2-1 because the NEWS file says
      "don't make texinfo by default" in Yodl 1.31.4, and otherwise
      the build process fails, most likely my fault.  :-)
  * [debian/rules]: Now, in the "clean:" target, runs either
      "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$SUDO_USER.$$SUDO_GID" or
      "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$LOGNAME" to deal with all those
      root-owned "out/*" files generated during a "sudo debian/rules clean"
      run.  Thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
      for reporting a similar problem with the lilypond package.  :-)
  * Removed postinst and prerm and adjusted debian/GNUmakefile accordingly,
    as Yodl's info files are not built or installed for this release.
  * [debian/control]: Oops!  Forgot to add dependencies!  :-)
      Added "Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}"
      and "Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1)".

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Oct 1998 14:47:05 -0600

yodl (1.31.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Applied patch 1.31.2.jbr1:
      - src/yodl/grampipethrough.c: A popen _must_ be closed with a
        pclose _not_ a fclose.  Pipes were never getting closed on
        Windows NT cygnus.
  * [Documentation/GNUmakefile]: Added "texinfo" to "default:",
      otherwise Documentation/out/yodl.info* would not be built
      and "make install" would complain.
  * [debian/postinst,debian/prerm]: Added calls to install-info.
  * [Documentation/links.yo]: The e-mail address and command for subscribing
      to the Yodl Mailing List was wrong.  Fixed.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Sep 1998 05:08:54 -0600

yodl (1.31.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian's FTP server.
  * Minor revisions in config.make.in and debian/rules.
  * Note that this package was created by Yodl and lilypond's co-author,
    Jan Nieuwenhuizen <janneke@gnu.org>.  He did all the Debianization
    work for me.  I am so amazed!  All I am doing now is uploading it. 
    Thanks a lot, Jan!  :-)
