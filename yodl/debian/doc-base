Title: Yodl, Your Other Document Languae
Author: Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl> and others
Abstract: Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and
 tools to process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document
 in a pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. yodl2html) to convert it
 to some final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, 
 man, LaTeX text and an experimental xml converter.  Main
 document types are "article", "report", "book" "manpage" and "letter".  The
 Yodl document language is designed to be easy to use and extensible.
