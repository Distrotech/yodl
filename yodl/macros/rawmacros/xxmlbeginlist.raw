<COMMENT>
    begins an xml item. The macro is defined only in xml
    conversion mode, as it is not called in other modes. It writes a 
    begin-tag for the item whose name is given as its second arg (e.g. li),
    and increments the counter given as its first argument. Just before
    generating the tag the tag is closed if the counter is non-zero.
