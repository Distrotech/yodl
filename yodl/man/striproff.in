    The bf(striproff) program is a very simple tool to strip ASCII control
    characters off a stream, so that only `bare' ASCII is left. The stripped
    control sequences are ^H (backspace) followed by any character; this
    mechanism is used to underline or boldface text on terminals that support
    it. 

    bf(striproff) is typically used with the Yodl converters bf(yodl2msless)
    and bf(yodl2manless).
