manpagedescription()

    This manual page describes the various shell scripts that convert
    documents in the Yodl language to other formats. The basic converters
    are:
    itemization(
    it() bf(yodl2html)(1): converts to HTML, writes a file with the extension
        bf(.html).
    it() bf(yodl2man)(1): converts to nroff `man' format, writes bf(.man). Can
        be further processed with e.g. bf(nroff -Tascii -man)
        em(file)bf(.man).
    it() bf(yodl2latex)(1): converts to LaTeX output, writes bf(.latex). Can
        be further processed with, e.g., bf(latex) em(file)bf(.latex).
    it() bf(yodl2txt)(1): converts to plain ASCII, writes bf(.txt). This is a
        very rudimentary converter, a last-resort.
    )
    COMMENT(
        dit(yodl2ms:) converts to nroff `ms' format, writes bf(.ms). Can be
            further processed with e.g. bf(nroff -T)em(format) bf(-mgs) 
            em(file)bf(.ms); em(format) being e.g., bf(ascii) or bf(ps).
        dit(yodl2sgml:) converts to SGML, writes bf(.sgml). Implemented for
        backward compatibility at our site, producing output for our `hacked 
        Linuxdoc-SGML mutant'.
        dit(yodl2texinfo:) converts to texinfo, the GNU document standard. 
            writes bf(.texinfo).
    )

manpageoptions()

    The options are identical to those of the bf(yodl)(1) program.
    Additionally, the option tt(--no-warnings) may be given. By default the
    convertors call bf(yodl)(1) using the tt(-w) flag. The option
    tt(--no-warnings) suppresses this flag.

manpagefiles()

    Each bf(yodl2)em(format) converter requires a file em(format.yo) in Yodl's
    include path (e.g., tt(@STD_INCLUDE@)). This file is auto-loaded before
    tt(FILE) (see the synopsys) is loaded, to make the conversion to
    em(format) possible.
    
    The output is written to one or more files having the extension
    em(.format).

manpagediagnostics()
    When the conversion is completed successfully, the converters return
    0. Otherwise a non-zero exit status is returned.
