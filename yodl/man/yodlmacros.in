            This manual page lists the standard macros of the Yodl package.

manpagedescription()
            The following list shows the macros defined by the Yodl converters
define and which can be used in Yodl documents. Refer to the Yodl user
guide, distributed with the Yodl package, for a full description.

The following list shows all macros of the package in alphabetical
        order.

manpageoptions()
    No options are relevant in respect to the macros.

manpagefiles()
    The files in bf(@STD_INCLUDE@) define the converter's macro packages. The
scripts bf(yodl2tex), bf(yodl2html), bf(yodl2man) etc. perform the
conversions.

     bf(yodl)(1), bf(yodlmanpage)(7), bf(yodlconverters)(1)

manpagediagnostics()
            Error messages and warnings are printed to stderr. There are too
            many warnings or error messages to enumerate, but they should be
            self-explanatory.

manpagebugs()
    The macro package may contain bugs, but I'm working on it. 
    Furthermore, the macro package may not be complete.
